# portfolio-website

Welcome to the repository for my personal portfolio website built using Next.js and TypeScript. This website serves as a showcase of my skills, projects, work experience, and educational background. Feel free to explore the code and the website itself to learn more about my journey and accomplishments.

## Technologies Used
- Next.js: This project is built upon the Next.js framework, which allows for server-side rendering, optimized routing, and a smooth development experience.
